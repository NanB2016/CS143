I did not pay attention to the precedence of let expression over other operators causing a lot of errors in parsing let expressions. I put the following line above other precedence declarations because let expression should have the lowest precedence.  

Here is the diff between my new and old cool.y
150d149
<     %right LET IN
159a159
>     %right LET IN
